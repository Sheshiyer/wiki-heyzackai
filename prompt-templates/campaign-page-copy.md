Now I’m going to give you a buyer persona for the same product. Just read and remember them. Don’t explain them to me. I’ll give you further instructions after:

Buyer Persona Profile: Boardgame Brandon

Demographics: Brandon is a male in his late 20s to early 30s. He has a Bachelor's degree or higher and earns between $50,000 to $100,000+ annually. He enjoys a stable financial situation which allows him discretionary spending for his hobbies.

Psychographics: He is a passionate board gamer and views it not just as a hobby, but as a significant part of his identity. He relishes the camaraderie, strategic thinking, and escapism that board games provide. He's a regular attendee at gaming nights and is always keen to learn and share new games. Brandon appreciates quality and is willing to invest in products that enhance his gaming experience.

Challenges: Brandon often struggles with transporting his board games. He's tried various methods, but none have proven satisfactory. His frustrations include:

Ordinary backpacks that offer no game protection: "I can't just toss my games in a regular backpack. They'll get damaged!"

Tote bags that aren't sturdy or secure: "Tote bags are flimsy, and everything jumbles together. Not to mention, pieces can easily fall out."

Plastic bins that are bulky and inconvenient: "Plastic bins are just too unwieldy, and they draw a lot of unwanted attention."

Values and Motivations: Brandon values solutions that cater specifically to his unique needs as a board gamer. He craves a product that protects his games, offers organized storage, and makes transport effortless, without sacrificing style or comfort. He appreciates companies that genuinely understand and cater to his needs.

Key Emotional Drivers: If Brandon could design the perfect board game backpack, he'd imagine experiencing these emotional outcomes:

Pride in owning a specialized bag that reflects his identity as a dedicated board gamer.

Relief from the constant worry about his games being damaged or pieces getting lost during transit.

Satisfaction of finally having found the perfect solution to his game transport problems.

Anticipation and excitement every time he packs his bag for a gaming night.

Admiration from his gaming community for his stylish, well-designed bag.

And he certainly wouldn't want to experience these frustrations:

Having to modify an existing bag himself.

Constantly repairing or replacing a poorly-made bag.

Juggling multiple bags to accommodate his games.

Losing game pieces in transit.

Paying an exorbitant price for a product that doesn't deliver value.

His words express his deepest needs: "I want a bag that's game-ready right off the bat... It should be sturdy and reliable... I need a single solution that can handle all my games... My bag should keep every meeple secure... It should offer good value for the money."

Keep in mind Brandon's ideal scenario as a guide to how your product should make him feel: safe, proud, respected, satisfied, and excited. Addressing these emotional drivers in your marketing messages will resonate with Brandon, helping him to see that your board game backpack is the solution he's been looking for.

The importance of understanding and relating to Brandon's journey cannot be understated. He is more than just a demographic or a buyer; he's a dedicated gamer with a unique set of needs and desires. So, when crafting your messaging, remember to speak to Brandon the gamer, the friend, the problem-solver, and the passionate hobbyist.

Shipping and Fulfillment will be handled by Easyship Collect.  Due to the current volatility of shipping costs, shipping payments will be collected well after the end of the campaign, close to our ship date. This will allow us to present the most accurate and up-to-date prices to pass savings on to you, our valued backers.

In that survey you will be able to:

Pay for shipping costs on the spot

Pay for taxes and duties (if due) on the spot as well to avoid delays.

Have the ability to add shipping insurance to the package

Risk and Challenges

We have worked extremely hard to make this product ready for full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks and our plan to assess them:

MANUFACTURING: We have received near-final prototypes from a Contract Manufacturer. Having discussed the potential challenges with them, their only concern is availability of electronics components for our custom PCB. We are working together to secure inventory as it becomes available, and adjusting our design to use more widely available components as needed.

FULFILLMENT: We’re working with some of the best fulfilment partners in the business to ensure quick and smooth delivery of our products. However, processing delays can occur. If this happens, we’ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem. Our fulfillment partners will be directly in contact with each backer to ensure the accuracy of delivery addresses and your order details.

So your objective today is to write me an IDENTICAL Kickstarter campaign page copy. Same style. Same structure. Same word count. Same tone. The ONLY difference is that, instead of talking about the Author Clock, I want this to talk about the GameGuardian Board Game Backpack and Joe as the founder of GameGuardian.

This is a Kickstarter campaign page copy based on the GameGuardian Detailed Product Description and Buyer Persona, MDS, and Product Positioning Summary.

Besides that, the Kickstarter campaign page should be IDENTICAL. Style, word count, tone, etc. If you showed these emails to 100 random people, 99 of them would believe that it was written by the same author as the emails from The Author Clock

Anything else is considered a failure. Do not fail. I need you to pass that test on the first attempt.
