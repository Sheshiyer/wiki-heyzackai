Buyer Persona Profile: Boardgame Brandon

Demographics: Brandon is a male in his late 20s to early 30s. He has a Bachelor's degree or higher and earns between $50,000 to $100,000+ annually. He enjoys a stable financial situation which allows him discretionary spending for his hobbies.

Psychographics: He is a passionate board gamer and views it not just as a hobby, but as a significant part of his identity.

Brandon appreciates quality and is willing to invest in products that enhance his gaming experience.

Challenges: Brandon often struggles with transporting his board games. He's tried various methods, but none have proven satisfactory. His frustrations include:

Ordinary backpacks that offer no game protection: "I can't just toss my games in a regular backpack. They'll get damaged!"

Tote bags that aren't sturdy or secure: "Tote bags are flimsy, and everything jumbles together. Not to mention, pieces can easily fall out."

Plastic bins that are bulky and inconvenient: "Plastic bins are just too unwieldy, and they draw a lot of unwanted attention."

He craves a product that protects his games, offers organized storage, and makes transport effortless, without sacrificing style or comfort.

Satisfaction of finally having found the perfect solution to his game transport problems.

Anticipation and excitement every time he packs his bag for a gaming night.

Admiration from his gaming community for his stylish, well-designed bag.

And he certainly wouldn't want to experience these frustrations:
