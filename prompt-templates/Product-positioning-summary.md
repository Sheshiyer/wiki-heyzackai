Ordinary backpacks that offer no game protection: "I can't just toss my games in a regular backpack. They'll get damaged!"

Tote bags that aren't sturdy or secure: "Tote bags are flimsy, and everything jumbles together. Not to mention, pieces can easily fall out."

Plastic bins that are bulky and inconvenient: "Plastic bins are just too unwieldy, and they draw a lot of unwanted attention."

### Prompt 4

Now you're a world-class marketing analyst with meticulous attention to detail. I want you to create a great Product Positioning summary. For your reference, great product positioning means effectively communicating the value of your product to your target audience, it involves having a lock on two key aspects:

1. Target audience: the people who experience the problem that your product solves
2. Communicating the value: explaining how your product solves their problem

You will be developing the product positioning summary using the Consumer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) framework. The underlying principle of CBBE framework is the assumption that you do not own your brand, but rather, consumers do. It’s a concept to them, something that lives rent-free in their minds. For that reason, we approach product positioning as if we are the consumer. The CBBE framework has 6 linear sections: Salience, Performance, Imagery, Judgments, Feelings, Resonance. I will be asking you questions for you to answer based on the detailed product description, buyer persona and competitor product. Please ask me any questions you like before we begin.

### ChatGPT

I understand your instructions clearly and am ready to create a product positioning summary using the Consumer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) framework. As per the CBBE model, we will be examining the brand equity of our product, the GameGuardian Board Game Backpack, from the perspective of our target consumer, Boardgame Brandon.

I believe I have all the information required to proceed, but I will reach out if I have any questions during the process. We can start with the first section, Salience.

### Prompt 5

I will provide you with all the questions from all the sections. Also, the competitor product is just a reference to help answer some questions. You are creating a Product Positioning Summary based on the GameGuardian product only. Understood?

### ChatGPT

Understood. I will be creating the Product Positioning Summary for the GameGuardian Board Game Backpack, using the information from its product description and the buyer persona, and only referencing the competitor product GeekOn when necessary. Please provide the questions for each section of the CBBE framework.

### Prompt 6

The first section of the CBBE framework is Salience. During this section, the consumer is asking the broad question, “Who are you?” If your brand has salience, they know who you are and they know what problem you solve.

The best way to establish salience is to state what problem you solve in the simplest way possible. You’ll want to use words and broad associations that consumers will recognize. This way, consumers can quickly associate your product with a category they already understand. Do not overthink this part! For example, on our campaign for the Give’r Frontier Mittens, our headline was “the best damn mittens ever.” The “mittens” part is playing to salience. We could have gone with “the quad-layer, super warm, hand insulator.” This is all true, but we didn’t choose that. Why? Because no one knows what that means. They can probably pull some associations from that sentence and may think it sounds cool, but if they aren’t 100% sure what you are, then we failed.

Here are the questions you must answer for the Salience section:

What product category are you in?

What problem do you solve?

What is your product in a sentence or two?

The second section, performance, the consumer is asking the question, “What are you?” This is where they are trying to understand what makes you different from the competition.

For example our LoftTek jacket was overengineered with a ton of features. This also illustrates both the points of parity and points of difference. For example, many jackets have zipper pockets, a hood, water resistance, etc. – consumers love these features. But not many jackets have all these features. The fact that LoftTek is overengineered is actually a feature. It’s a point of difference. This is the level of detail you’ll want to write out in your questionnaire. In the end, the main goal of these questions is for you to identify how you are better than your competition. Ideally, you’ll have 3 main points of difference.

Here are the questions you must answer for the Performance section:

What makes you different from your competition (points of difference)?

What makes you similar to your competition (points of parity)?

What are the core features of your product?  How valuable is your product?

do not mention the competitor when answering the questions.

The third section is Imagery. Now, you have a new brand. When someone hears your product’s name, nothing will come to mind. But you can change that by identifying which well-known brands you want to be associated with and choose imagery that will stick with your customer. When we launched the William Painter Empire sunglasses, we wanted to associate their brand with one that was high-tech, adventurous, and innovative. That’s why we chose NASA. Our top performing headline in ads was “These NASA Inspired Sunglasses Are Made Of Aerospace-Grade Titanium.”

Here are the questions you must answer for the Imagery section:

What brands would you associate with your product?

Where is your product used?

How is your product used?

The four sections are judgements. During this level, the consumer is asking the question, “How good are you?” Essentially, the consumer is trying to figure out what they think and feel about your brand/product. They are taking your performance and imagery points from the previous section, evaluating them, and forming opinions about them.

For our client, The Neck Hammock, who raised $1,642,934, we claimed it could give neck pain relief in ten minutes or less. We knew that this would cause concern and doubt in people. Here are some concerns that we thought people would have: Is there scientific evidence of why it works?  Are there testimonials from people that have used it?  What credibility does the person have that created it?  Each of these concerns, and many more, were directly addressed in our messaging. For example… Is there scientific evidence of why it works?  We explained the science of Cervical Traction and how it works.  What credibility does the person have that created it?  The founder is a doctor and licensed physical therapist and used the device on his patients.  Are there testimonials from people that have used it?  We included written and video testimonials from the founder’s clients.  Because we took the time to identify possible judgements before we launched, we were able to address any concerns, doubts, or questions of credibility directly within our messaging.

Here are the questions you must answer for the  judgements section:

What positive judgments will people have about your product?

What concerns or doubts may people have about your product?

What credibility do you have in the market?

I want you to also address any concerns or doubts our target audience might have.

The fifth section is Feelings.

Our client AIR PIX, who raised $1,615,135, is an aerial drone that allows you to take photo and video selfies. We wanted to capture the feelings of youthfulness and fun. When thinking through this, we knew that the word “drone” did not convey those feelings. Most consumers associate drones with tech-focused brands or the military. This is not the mental imagery we wanted the potential consumer to associate with AIR PIX. To combat this, we decided to drop the word “drone” from our messaging. Instead, we called AIR PIX an “aerial camera” and our most popular headline was “your pocket-sized aerial photographer.” Even though it’s technically a drone, we found another way to describe what AIR PIX is without that word.

Here are the questions you must answer for the feelings section:

How do you want people to feel when using your product?

What is the voice of your message? (As a friend, a teacher, a doctor, a professional, an expert - what type of language will we be using?)

What is the tone of your message? (Funny, somber, optimistic, epic, intense, friendly, etc.)

The sixth section is Resonance.

During this section, the consumer is asking the question, “What about you and me?” This is where we identify reasons why the consumer will have a loyal, active relationship with your brand.

For our client, etee, a membership club for those that want plastic-free alternatives to everyday items, we were able to lean heavily into resonance. Their mission is to remove plastic from our world. This is a massive goal, but one that their audience can get behind. Not every product has such an altruistic mission, and that’s okay! Starbucks for example, At the end of the day, they are making coffee which is great and all, but the world doesn’t need it the same way we need to reduce our plastic consumption. Still, Starbucks has been able to build an extremely loyal and active customer base by focusing on fulfilling their mission: “to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” This may sound a bit aspirational for a coffee company, but Starbucks is doing this one way or another, which is how they are so successful.

Here are the questions you must answer for the Resonance section:

 Why would you be missed?

 How is your mission in alignment with your customer’s mission?

 What are your core values?

 Why will your customers only choose you?
