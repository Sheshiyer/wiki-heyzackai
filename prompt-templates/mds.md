### Prompt 3 — Category Alternatives & Why They Fall Short

Now I’m going to show you category alternatives Alex Kim has tried. Read and remember. Don’t explain.

Alternatives (with pain points):
1) Smart speakers (Echo Dot Kids / Google Nest)
- Hopes: "Voice beats screens—maybe we can learn by talking."
- Reality: Generic responses, adult‑oriented tone, opaque data practices; no relationship.

2) Tablets & educational apps
- Hopes: Adaptive apps teach while parents multitask.
- Reality: Reward loops; screen friction returns; shallow reasoning; policing needed.

3) Audio story players (Yoto/Toniebox)
- Hopes: Screen‑free audio; curated content.
- Reality: One‑way listening; no Q&A or adapting to curiosity; repetitive over time.

4) STEM robots (e.g., Miko)
- Hopes: Playful robot; interactive learning.
- Reality: Scripted feel; shallow day‑to‑day; cloud dependent; toy‑like aesthetics.

5) DIY Raspberry Pi projects
- Hopes: Private, local experience.
- Reality: Fragile; maintenance burden; limited emotional intelligence; no evolving memory.

Summary Insight:
Most products force a trade‑off between engagement and healthy development. Zack AI aims to break that trade‑off with privacy‑first, screen‑free conversation that grows with the child.
