# ZACK AI BUYER PERSONA DEVELOPMENT TODO

## In Progress

## Pending

### Phase 1: Core Buyer Persona Construction
- [DONE] ~~**Prompt 1 - Comprehensive Buyer Persona Profile**: Construct a comprehensive buyer persona profile for Zack AI, a smart plush toy that uses conversational AI, emotion recognition, and screen-free interaction to help children develop emotional intelligence and curiosity. Focus on demographics, psychographics, main challenges, values, and motivations of the typical buyer who is usually a parent or gift-giver in the EU/FR market, aged 28-45, with household income €40,000-€80,000+, concerned about screen time and seeking educational alternatives. Provide a real name for this persona.~~

### Phase 2: Previous Solution Analysis  
- [ ] **Prompt 2 - Previous Methods & Frustrations**: As someone who's struggled with finding screen-free educational solutions for their child's development, identify previous methods [PERSONA] has likely tried to address screen time concerns and learning engagement. List frustrations with each method as direct quotes from [PERSONA], including: educational apps/tablets, traditional toys, books, educational videos, learning games, tutoring, and other tech alternatives.

- [ ] **Prompt 3 - Why Solutions Failed**: Explain to [PERSONA] (in the tone of a trusted friend) why each of those solutions they tried likely failed them. Because those methods didn't directly address the real root cause of [PERSONA'S MAIN CHALLENGE] - finding a truly engaging, educational, screen-free solution that develops emotional intelligence. Instead, [PERSONA] needs to try something new: Zack AI's conversational AI companion that learns and grows with their child.

- [ ] **Prompt 4 - Failure Soundbites**: Turn the failure explanations into short soundbites explaining why different methods failed to deliver the screen-free educational results [PERSONA] wanted. Create short quotes for each failed method (educational apps, traditional toys, books, videos, etc.).

### Phase 3: Ideal Solution Mapping
- [DONE] ~~**Prompt 6 - Magic Genie Outcomes**: Now that [PERSONA] knows the importance of a screen-free AI learning companion specifically designed for children's emotional and intellectual development, imagine they meet a magic genie that can create the perfect AI companion. List 20 outcomes [PERSONA] would want this new solution to bring their child, focusing on: emotional intelligence, curiosity development, language skills, creativity, confidence, social skills, and learning engagement.~~

- [DONE] ~~**Prompt 7 - Unwanted Requirements**: List 20 things [PERSONA] DOESN'T want to have to do to get these amazing results for their child. Be specific about: setup complexity, ongoing maintenance, privacy concerns, cost factors, time investment, technical requirements, and safety worries.~~

- [DONE] ~~**Prompt 8 - Resistance Quotes**: Give direct quotes from [PERSONA NAME] talking about how they don't want to deal with any of these unwanted requirements when seeking an educational solution for their child.~~

### Phase 4: Emotional Impact Analysis
- [DONE] ~~**Prompt 9 - Life Impact Scenarios**: Assuming the genie granted [PERSONA NAME] all these wishes for their child's development, describe specific ways this would impact their family life. If their child had the perfect AI learning companion that develops emotional intelligence and curiosity without screens, how would it affect daily routines, parent-child bonding, learning outcomes, and family dynamics? List 15-20 specific emotional outcomes focusing on parental pride, child confidence, family harmony, and developmental milestones.~~

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Documentation
- [DONE] ~~**Prompt 10 - Master Persona Summary**: Create a comprehensive, detailed summary of the Zack AI buyer persona including all relevant details, quotes, and deep emotional drivers that inspire parents like [PERSONA NAME] to invest in their child's screen-free educational development. This summary must be designed to inform future advertising materials, email campaigns, Kickstarter copy, and video scripts. Include all emotional drivers, frustration quotes, desired outcomes, and resistance points. Structure for maximum utility in campaign development.~~
