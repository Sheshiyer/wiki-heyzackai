## Psychographic Deep Dive

1. **Guilt & Inadequacy**: "I feel like I'm failing them when I see other kids already reading chapter books while Emma still struggles with simple sentences."

2. **Time Scarcity Anxiety**: "Between work and everything else, I barely have quality time with them. When I do, I want it to matter."

### Authentic Voice Quotes

**On Educational Apps**: "Another app promising to make learning 'fun'? My kids get bored after five minutes, and I'm left wondering what they actually learned besides how to tap a screen faster."

**On Traditional Toys**: "These 'educational' toys are just plastic junk with batteries. They make noise, flash lights, and teach nothing meaningful. Plus, they break within months."

**On Screen Time**: "I'm not anti-technology, but I want my children to learn through conversation and discovery, not by staring at another screen."

**On Privacy**: "Why does a children's learning app need access to our location, contacts, and camera? It feels invasive and unnecessary."
