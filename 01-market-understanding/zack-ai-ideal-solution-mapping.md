# Zack AI: Ideal Solution Mapping
*From Sophie Dubois's Perspective*

**"I need something that grows WITH my children, not something they outgrow in 3 months. Something that makes them excited to learn, but also teaches them to be thoughtful, curious humans. And honestly? I need to feel confident that I'm making the right choice as a parent."**
