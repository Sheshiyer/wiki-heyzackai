[Heyzack.ai](https://heyzack.ai/), a pioneer in AI-powered smart home automation, today announced the launch of

[Zack AI](https://heyzack.ai/zackai), a next-generation smart plush that unites emotion, learning, and play through the power of conversation.

Zack AI, the smart plush, uses advanced conversational AI, emotion recognition, and LED animated eyes to create a truly lifelike and responsive experience. It's not just a toy—it's a friend that learns, listens, and grows, forming a genuine connection with each child through dialogue, curiosity, and discovery.

A smart companion for developing minds. Designed as both an educational and emotional companion, Zack AI helps children develop their emotional intelligence while discovering the world around them. Whether explaining “why the sky is blue,” narrating imaginative space adventures, or practicing languages, Zack AI turns every conversation into an opportunity to learn and explore.

The toy interacts naturally with children—telling stories, offering interactive games, asking follow-up questions, and even adjusting its tone based on a child’s emotions. Over time, Zack AI develops memory-based personality traits, remembering favorite topics, moods, and first names to create a personalized and meaningful connection.

Connectivity includes Wi‑Fi 2.4G (2.4–2.485 GHz); multilingual support; voice cloning (with parental consent); and adaptive long‑term memory. Zack defaults to local processing and provides robust parental controls; no third‑party data sharing. Parents can customize its responses and interaction modes via a companion app to ensure a safe, age‑appropriate experience.

## Screen-Free Playtime Experience

In a world dominated by tablets and smartphones, Zack AI introduces a screen-free playtime experience. Its goal is to help kids engage their imagination and curiosity through conversation, not scrolling.

Zack AI answers questions, shares daily fun facts, tells bedtime stories in different voices, and helps kids learn languages or problem-solving basics through playful dialogue. It's a safe, interactive, and emotionally aware experience that encourages curiosity—without increasing screen time. The perfect gift for smarter holidays

As the holiday season approaches, Zack AI stands out as one of the most innovative and touching gifts that combines fun, emotional development, and real-world insights—making it one of the most thoughtful presents parents can give this year.

Families can pre-order Zack AI today at Heyzack.ai/zackai, with shipments beginning in November 2025—just in time for the holidays.

**Optional Smart Home Connectivity**

While primarily designed as a child’s learning companion, Zack AI can also act as a voice-access gateway to Heyzack.ai’s growing smart home ecosystem. Parents can choose to enable features like controlling the lights, adjusting the temperature, or playing soothing music at bedtime—all through Zack’s friendly voice.

This optional integration reflects Heyzack.ai’s broader mission: to build AI-powered smart home automation that is intelligent, emotional, and seamlessly connected.
