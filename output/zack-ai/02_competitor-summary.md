frequently asked questions and answers (FAQs:)

Question:Dose this backpack have a warranty that comes with it?

Answer:Yes it has a Lifetime Warranty

Question:Does secret Hitler and Betrayal Legacy fit in the backpack?

Answer:yeah, it fits Gloomhaven, so it should fit those as well....

Question:How long do the straps last? How tough is it?

Answer:The backpack is very tough: I carried it completly full several times, sometimes exceeding the tested weight; and still show no strain on the structure or the straps.

Question:What is the widest diameter water bottle the water pocket can handle?

Answer:My 24oz narrow hydro flask fits pretty nicely at about 2 3/4" diameter. I would say a 3" diameter is about as big as you can go, and that's a pretty snug fit. Its really made for a typical 16oz retail water bottle

Question:Has anyone tried taking the backpack as a carryon on a flight?

Answer:YES! You can see a message from a Kickstarter backer here: https://imgur.com/Ft4yxKX

Question:Has anyone tried using this bag to carry foam trays for Warhammer 40k?

Answer:I haven't used it for that, but you'd essentially be carrying foam inside of foam--if you packed it snugly it might be okay, but this isn't a hard case.

Question:How well do the games ride in the large compartment when not full? Is there a way to cinch it down to prevent movement?

Answer:Theiy’re ain’t a clinch it down exactly but when it’s not full there’s a way in the compartment to move em when they’re riding it’s aight

Question:Can I carry my dnd stuff in this bag? Books, screen, and all?

Answer:I would say, yes. This bag expands. It’s wide & deep enough to fit the Borg box cube set with all the Star Trek RPG stuff plus additional games on top, and everything needed for RPG. I bought it for my husband, but it’s comfortable enough for me to wear too. It was a lifesaver at Gen Con. It even fits the Gloomhaven b… see more

Question:Does this come with the dice box and box straps?

Answer:No this listing is just for the Ultimate Boardgame Backpack.

Question:Is there a guide to all the various pull downs with in the main compartment and what they do?

Answer:There isnt a guide but their is a you tube video review of this backpack and if you carry a bunch of games and have alot of money invested in them this bag is great

Question:what sized laptop can the bag fit? 15 inch? 17 inch?

Answer:It can definitely hold a 15" laptop easily and if you have a 17" laptop you can undo the velcro on top of the laptop section (this connects to the back wall of the backpack) and this will allow for a larger laptop to fit in.

Question:What size laptop can fit in the laptop compartment/ what are the dimensions of the compartment?

Answer:Laptop compartment (inches): 15.25”H x 13.25”W x 0.75”D

Question:is the whole bag waterproof?

Answer:That’s what it was advertised as. I haven’t had it rained on to know for sure.

reviews:

Ripped in the first time trying to fit a game.

I can't even open one zipper without using my whole strength. Zippers are so tight and rigid that hurt my hands.

Bag is too bulgy without a reason i feel like carrying mor plastic and foam padding from the bag then my boardgames.

All the pockets they put are useless, there is no space in them, they filled them with more Velcro and springs and holders that the space is nule.

Too much marketing poor design.

The bag is sturdy, spacious and definitely worth the money with 1 quick warning to those looking to fly with it. It is NOT carryon compliant when fully expanded. They will make you check it if you stuff it to the gills, fully expanded and try to bring it on a plane. It does not fit in either the overhead compartment or under a seat when fully expanded.

Im aware that it seems like a no brainer, but the boyfriend bought it because it's "carryon compatible" and filled it to the brim only to find himself buying another bag in the airport because it was cheaper to buy another bag than check this one.

This is a great bag and I highly recommend it. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the price point. It is extremely high at $199.99 at the time I purchased. You might be telling yourself "then why did this jackass buy it then". Well......... I'm a shopaholic and I like things to look neat. This bag has it all if you like to travel with ur games ;)

I'm very pleased with the quality and sturdiness of this bag. I'm very glad I own it- it makes bringing games much easier than totebags, etc. As said, I wish it was cheaper, but with how often I'll use it (and it also seems like it will last for years), I feel like it was a worthwhile investment. I also appreciate the waterproof type zippers. That's a nice detail. And I like how my games feel safer in this bag because of the padding too.

The ultimate board game backpack is an amazing bag for carrying your tabletop games where you need to go. The only drawback I see with it is the price tag is a bit steep for what its purpose is, but if you like to have premium products for your hobby, this is definitely the premium bag for this particular aspect of the hobby. Highly recommend!

This bag is what it advertises. I posted photos so you can see what it looks like expanded and with three large to huge games. It was a breeze to setup and tote away. The straps do not feel flimsy and secure. Being able to store even smaller games on the top compartment as well helps out too! My last outting (didn’t photograph ) I had near 10 games with me and was able to fit Formula D that my friends bought for my birthday. Oh, and don’t forget the pouch for your iPad, for those app enhanced games.

I chose purple because it would stick out in a crowd of black and gray bags. The material is premium and collapsed it fits away easily.

I would say the worst part is not knowing how big you are now on the back side and bumping into things.

Well worth the purchase. No more CoolStuffGames totes to carry around games!

 It will fit just about anything a gamer wants to carry! I am very impressed with the capacity and functionality of this backpack. I am an avid board gamer and Magic the Gathering player. It can hold comfortably just about anything you want to carry. When the back pack is extended it can carry four to five card binders. It is able to carry all of my deck boxes, playmats, and trade boxes while it is collapsed. All of the pockets make easy access for token cards, dice, computer. Cons from what I can tell the coozy pockets the coozy part doesn’t come out so take some space away. It took me a minute to figure out how to expand the bag, but it has foldable flaps to support the sides and bottom which was a nice touch.

Overall I recommend this bag to any trading card player, board gamer, or good for a short term trip bag.

My image wouldn’t attach to the review but could easily fit my big box of hero’s realm, two ticket to ride boxes, 7 wonder box, and three smaller games easily.

Best gaming backpack, but a little expensive I have been looking to get a board game backpack for a while now. I just never wanted to drop the cash to get one. Over the last year or so I've been researching the different options. Originally I had planned on purchasing the ENHANCE bag. I had it in my wishlist for some time. I loved the flat storage and the map pockets.

It’s a little pricey. I previously bought this item at Gen Con and loved it. It’s big enough to put a lot of my stuff in. I used it to put my magic the gathering cards in. It blows away so would say about 90 % of the other bags out there in size and quality.

 Perfect gift for anybody who loves board games! I purchased this as a gift for my brother and he loves it! It holds so many games and has so many extra compartments, and specialty pockets for everything you could imagine. He can’t wait to show it off to all his other friends who play board games and we expect they will be purchasing ones for themselves in the near future!

Great board game bag but price is a little high. First off let me just say it is a great bag with a lot of room and looks to be made very well. The only minor issue I have is one the price is a little steep. Personally I am finally at a point in my life where I can afford to get a few nice things so it's no issue for me but if bills are an issue give this buy a little thought.
