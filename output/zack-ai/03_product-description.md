Buyer Persona:

Buyer Persona Profile: Boardgame Brandon

Demographics: Brandon is a male in his late 20s to early 30s. He has a Bachelor's degree or higher and earns between $50,000 to $100,000+ annually. He enjoys a stable financial situation which allows him discretionary spending for his hobbies.

Psychographics: He is a passionate board gamer and views it not just as a hobby, but as a significant part of his identity. He relishes the camaraderie, strategic thinking, and escapism that board games provide. He's a regular attendee at gaming nights and is always keen to learn and share new games. Brandon appreciates quality and is willing to invest in products that enhance his gaming experience.

Challenges: Brandon often struggles with transporting his board games. He's tried various methods, but none have proven satisfactory. His frustrations include:

Ordinary backpacks that offer no game protection: "I can't just toss my games in a regular backpack. They'll get damaged!"

Tote bags that aren't sturdy or secure: "Tote bags are flimsy, and everything jumbles together. Not to mention, pieces can easily fall out."

Plastic bins that are bulky and inconvenient: "Plastic bins are just too unwieldy, and they draw a lot of unwanted attention."

Values and Motivations: Brandon values solutions that cater specifically to his unique needs as a board gamer. He craves a product that protects his games, offers organized storage, and makes transport effortless, without sacrificing style or comfort. He appreciates companies that genuinely understand and cater to his needs.

Key Emotional Drivers: If Brandon could design the perfect board game backpack, he'd imagine experiencing these emotional outcomes:

Pride in owning a specialized bag that reflects his identity as a dedicated board gamer.

Relief from the constant worry about his games being damaged or pieces getting lost during transit.

Satisfaction of finally having found the perfect solution to his game transport problems.

Anticipation and excitement every time he packs his bag for a gaming night.

Admiration from his gaming community for his stylish, well-designed bag.

And he certainly wouldn't want to experience these frustrations:

Having to modify an existing bag himself.

Constantly repairing or replacing a poorly-made bag.

Juggling multiple bags to accommodate his games.

Losing game pieces in transit.

Paying an exorbitant price for a product that doesn't deliver value.

His words express his deepest needs: "I want a bag that's game-ready right off the bat... It should be sturdy and reliable... I need a single solution that can handle all my games... My bag should keep every meeple secure... It should offer good value for the money."

Keep in mind Brandon's ideal scenario as a guide to how your product should make him feel: safe, proud, respected, satisfied, and excited. Addressing these emotional drivers in your marketing messages will resonate with Brandon, helping him to see that your board game backpack is the solution he's been looking for.

The importance of understanding and relating to Brandon's journey cannot be understated. He is more than just a demographic or a buyer; he's a dedicated gamer with a unique set of needs and desires. So, when crafting your messaging, remember to speak to Brandon the gamer, the friend, the problem-solver, and the passionate hobbyist.
